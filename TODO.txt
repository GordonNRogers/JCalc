x Fix visual issue where the height of the display row changes when it goes from empty to containing text.
x Add replace M with MS/MR
x Add a backspace button???

- add code to handle MS/MR/M+/M-, <-, 1/x, %
- Investigate using BCD or some other encoding/number handling to eliminate floating-point errors
- Define what happens if you press two commands consecutively (ie. "+*").
       It's not a valid operation, so maybe treat is a a clear or show "Error"
- Round the corners of the buttons, maybe the frame.
